We believe that teachers should focus on teaching, not paperwork or manual tracking. That’s why MyHessa was built to help educators organize classes, manage students, track attendance, control payments, and share educational content easily in one place.
Our mission is to digitize private education management with a simple, reliable, and Arabic-first experience that fits the local education system, while also supporting English for wider accessibility.
MyHessa is designed with teachers in mind — simple to use, efficient, and built to solve real problems faced in private lessons.',
